Aliens, what are they?
- Aliens are extraterrestrial beings, that do not have a set lifespan. They are "immortal". Aliens, just like humans, come in all types. Some aliens are just honest people trying to make a living. Some aliens are "anti-human" and hate anything remotely related to humans and would kill all humans IMMEDIATELY. Aliens, however, can die by 1 method. Suffocation. Aliens cannot breathe in a human atmostphere, they can only breathe underwater or in a complete vaccum.
